####1. Design Pseudo Ground Truth with Motion Cue for Unsupervised Video Object   Segmentation
#####**Authors**: Ye Wang,Jongmoo Choi,Yueru Chen,Qin Huang,Siyang Li,Ming-Sui Lee,C. -C. Jay Kuo
> **Abstract:** One major technique debt in video object segmentation is to label the object masks for training instances. As a result, we propose to prepare inexpensive, yet high quality pseudo ground truth corrected with motion cue for video object segmentation training. Our method conducts semantic segmentation using instance segmentation networks and, then, selects the segmented object of interest as the pseudo ground truth based on the motion information. Afterwards, the pseudo ground truth is exploited to finetune the pretrained objectness network to facilitate object segmentation in the remaining frames of the video. We show that the pseudo ground truth could effectively improve the segmentation performance. This straightforward unsupervised video object segmentation method is more efficient than existing methods. Experimental results on DAVIS and FBMS show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods on various benchmark datasets. And the category-agnostic pseudo ground truth has great potential to extend to multiple arbitrary object tracking.

####3. Nrityantar: Pose oblivious Indian classical dance sequence   classification system
#####**Authors**: Vinay Kaushik,Prerana Mukherjee,Brejesh Lall
> **Abstract:** In this paper, we attempt to advance the research work done in human action recognition to a rather specialized application namely Indian Classical Dance (ICD) classification. The variation in such dance forms in terms of hand and body postures, facial expressions or emotions and head orientation makes pose estimation an extremely challenging task. To circumvent this problem, we construct a pose-oblivious shape signature which is fed to a sequence learning framework. The pose signature representation is done in two-fold process. First, we represent person-pose in first frame of a dance video using symmetric Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) to extract good person object proposals and CNN-based parallel single person pose estimator (SPPE). Next, the pose basis are converted to pose flows by assigning a similarity score between successive poses followed by non-maximal suppression. Instead of feeding a simple chain of joints in the sequence learner which generally hinders the network performance we constitute a feature vector of the normalized distance vectors, flow, angles between anchor joints which captures the adjacency configuration in the skeletal pattern. Thus, the kinematic relationship amongst the body joints across the frames using pose estimation helps in better establishing the spatio-temporal dependencies. We present an exhaustive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art deep network based methods for dance classification on ICD dataset.

####4. ELASTIC: Improving CNNs with Instance Specific Scaling Policies
#####**Authors**: Huiyu Wang,Aniruddha Kembhavi,Ali Farhadi,Alan Yuille,Mohammad Rastegari
> **Abstract:** Scale variation has been a challenge from traditional to modern approaches in computer vision. Most solutions to scale issues have similar theme: a set of intuitive and manually designed policies that are generic and fixed (e.g. SIFT or feature pyramid). We argue that the scale policy should be learned from data. In this paper, we introduce ELASTIC, a simple, efficient and yet very effective approach to learn instance-specific scale policy from data. We formulate the scaling policy as a non-linear function inside the network's structure that (a) is learned from data, (b) is instance specific, (c) does not add extra computation, and (d) can be applied on any network architecture. We applied ELASTIC to several state-of-the-art network architectures and showed consistent improvement without extra (sometimes even lower) computation on ImageNet classification, MSCOCO multi-label classification, and PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation. Our results show major improvement for images with scale challenges e.g. images with several small objects or objects with large scale variations. Our code and models will be publicly available soon.

####5. IPOD: Intensive Point-based Object Detector for Point Cloud
#####**Authors**: Zetong Yang,Yanan Sun,Shu Liu,Xiaoyong Shen,Jiaya Jia
> **Abstract:** We present a novel 3D object detection framework, named IPOD, based on raw point cloud. It seeds object proposal for each point, which is the basic element. This paradigm provides us with high recall and high fidelity of information, leading to a suitable way to process point cloud data. We design an end-to-end trainable architecture, where features of all points within a proposal are extracted from the backbone network and achieve a proposal feature for final bounding inference. These features with both context information and precise point cloud coordinates yield improved performance. We conduct experiments on KITTI dataset, evaluating our performance in terms of 3D object detection, Bird's Eye View (BEV) detection and 2D object detection. Our method accomplishes new state-of-the-art , showing great advantage on the hard set.

####6. FDFNet : A Secure Cancelable Deep Finger Dorsal Template Generation   Network Secured via. Bio-Hashing
#####**Authors**: Avantika Singh,Ashish Arora,Shreya Hasmukh Patel,Gaurav Jaswal,Aditya Nigam
> **Abstract:** Present world has already been consistently exploring the fine edges of online and digital world by imposing multiple challenging problems/scenarios. Similar to physical world, personal identity management is very crucial in-order to provide any secure online system. Last decade has seen a lot of work in this area using biometrics such as face, fingerprint, iris etc. Still there exist several vulnerabilities and one should have to address the problem of compromised biometrics much more seriously, since they cannot be modified easily once compromised. In this work, we have proposed a secure cancelable finger dorsal template generation network (learning domain specific features) secured via. Bio-Hashing. Proposed system effectively protects the original finger dorsal images by withdrawing compromised template and reassigning the new one. A novel Finger-Dorsal Feature Extraction Net (FDFNet) has been proposed for extracting the discriminative features. This network is exclusively trained on trait specific features without using any kind of pre-trained architecture. Later Bio-Hashing, a technique based on assigning a tokenized random number to each user, has been used to hash the features extracted from FDFNet. To test the performance of the proposed architecture, we have tested it over two benchmark public finger knuckle datasets: PolyU FKP and PolyU Contactless FKI. The experimental results shows the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of security and accuracy.

####7. When Semi-Supervised Learning Meets Transfer Learning: Training   Strategies, Models and Datasets
#####**Authors**: Hong-Yu Zhou,Avital Oliver,Jianxin Wu,Yefeng Zheng
> **Abstract:** Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been proved to be an effective way to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data at the same time. Recent semi-supervised approaches focus on deep neural networks and have achieved promising results on several benchmarks: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN. However, most of their experiments are based on models trained from scratch instead of pre-trained models. On the other hand, transfer learning has demonstrated its value when the target domain has limited labeled data. Here comes the intuitive question: is it possible to incorporate SSL when fine-tuning a pre-trained model? We comprehensively study how SSL methods starting from pretrained models perform under varying conditions, including training strategies, architecture choice and datasets. From this study, we obtain several interesting and useful observations.   While practitioners have had an intuitive understanding of these observations, we do a comprehensive emperical analysis and demonstrate that: (1) the gains from SSL techniques over a fully-supervised baseline are smaller when trained from a pre-trained model than when trained from random initialization, (2) when the domain of the source data used to train the pre-trained model differs significantly from the domain of the target task, the gains from SSL are significantly higher and (3) some SSL methods are able to advance fully-supervised baselines (like Pseudo-Label).   We hope our studies can deepen the understanding of SSL research and facilitate the process of developing more effective SSL methods to utilize pre-trained models. Code is now available at github.

####8. Omni-directional Feature Learning for Person Re-identification
#####**Authors**: Di Wu,Hong-Wei Yang,De-Shuang Huang
> **Abstract:** Person re-identification (PReID) has received increasing attention due to it is an important part in intelligent surveillance. Recently, many state-of-the-art methods on PReID are part-based deep models. Most of them focus on learning the part feature representation of person body in horizontal direction. However, the feature representation of body in vertical direction is usually ignored. Besides, the spatial information between these part features and the different feature channels is not considered. In this study, we introduce a multi-branches deep model for PReID. Specifically, the model consists of five branches. Among the five branches, two of them learn the local feature with spatial information from horizontal or vertical orientations, respectively. The other one aims to learn interdependencies knowledge between different feature channels generated by the last convolution layer. The remains of two other branches are identification and triplet sub-networks, in which the discriminative global feature and a corresponding measurement can be learned simultaneously. All the five branches can improve the representation learning. We conduct extensive comparative experiments on three PReID benchmarks including CUHK03, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID. The proposed deep framework outperforms many state-of-the-art in most cases.

####9. DLOW: Domain Flow for Adaptation and Generalization
#####**Authors**: Rui Gong,Wen Li,Yuhua Chen,Luc Van Gool
> **Abstract:** In this work, we propose a domain flow generation(DLOW) approach to model the domain shift between two domains by generating a continuous sequence of intermediate domains flowing from one domain to the other. The benefits of our DLOW model are two-fold. First, it is able to transfer source images into different styles in the intermediate domains. The transferred images smoothly bridge the gap between source and target domains, thus easing the domain adaptation task. Second, when multiple target domains are provided in the training phase, our DLOW model can be learnt to generate new styles of images that are unseen in the training data. We implement our DLOW model based on the state-of-the-art CycleGAN. A domainness variable is introduced to guide the model to generate the desired intermediate domain images. In the inference phase, a flow of various styles of images can be obtained by varying the domainness variable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for both cross-domain semantic segmentation and the style generalization tasks on benchmark datasets.

####10. Discovering and Generating Hard Examples for Training a Red Tide   Detector
#####**Authors**: Hyungtae Lee,Heesung Kwon,Wonkook Kim
> **Abstract:** Currently, accurate detection of natural phenomena, such as red tide, that adversely affect wildlife and human, using satellite images has been increasingly utilized. However, red tide detection on satellite images still remains a very hard task due to unpredictable nature of red tide occurrence, extreme sparsity of red tide samples, difficulties in accurate groundtruthing, etc. In this paper, we aim to tackle both the data sparsity and groundtruthing issues by primarily addressing two challenges: i) extreme data imbalance between red tide and non-red tide examples and ii) significant lack of hard examples of non-red tide that can enhance detection performance. In the proposed work, we devise a 9-layer fully convolutional network jointly optimized with two plug-in modules tailored to overcoming the two challenges: i) cascaded online hard example mining (cOHEM) to ease the data imbalance and ii) a hard negative example generator (HNG) to supplement the hard negative (non-red tide) examples. Our proposed network jointly trained with cOHEM and HNG provides state-of-the-art red tide detection accuracy on GOCI satellite images.

####11. Using Motion and Internal Supervision in Object Recognition
#####**Authors**: Daniel Harari
> **Abstract:** In this thesis we address two related aspects of visual object recognition: the use of motion information, and the use of internal supervision, to help unsupervised learning. These two aspects are inter-related in the current study, since image motion is used for internal supervision, via the detection of spatiotemporal events of active-motion and the use of tracking. Most current work in object recognition deals with static images during both learning and recognition. In contrast, we are interested in a dynamic scene where visual processes, such as detecting motion events and tracking, contribute spatiotemporal information, which is useful for object attention, motion segmentation, 3-D understanding and object interactions. We explore the use of these sources of information in both learning and recognition processes. In the first part of the work, we demonstrate how motion can be used for adaptive detection of object-parts in dynamic environments, while automatically learning new object appearances and poses. In the second and main part of the study we develop methods for using specific types of visual motion to solve two difficult problems in unsupervised visual learning: learning to recognize hands by their appearance and by context, and learning to extract direction of gaze. We use our conclusions in this part to propose a model for several aspects of learning by human infants from their visual environment.

####12. Human Motion Prediction via Spatio-Temporal Inpainting
#####**Authors**: Alejandro Hernandez Ruiz,Juergen Gall,Francesc Moreno-Noguer
> **Abstract:** We propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to forecast 3D human motion given a sequence of observed 3D skeleton poses. While recent GANs have shown promising results, they can only forecast plausible human-like motion over relatively short periods of time, i.e. a few hundred milliseconds, and typically ignore the absolute position of the skeleton w.r.t. the camera. The GAN scheme we propose can reliably provide long term predictions of two seconds or more for both the non-rigid body pose and its absolute position, and can be trained in an self-supervised manner. Our approach builds upon three main contributions. First, we consider a data representation based on a spatio-temporal tensor of 3D skeleton coordinates which allows us to formulate the prediction problem as an inpainting one, for which GANs work particularly well. Secondly, we design a GAN architecture to learn the joint distribution of body poses and global motion, allowing us to hypothesize large chunks of the input 3D tensor with missing data. And finally, we argue that the L2 metric, which is considered so far by most approaches, fails to capture the actual distribution of long-term human motion. We therefore propose an alternative metric that is more correlated with human perception. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state of the art for human motion forecasting and that it also handles situations in which past observations are corrupted by severe occlusions, noise and consecutive missing frames.

####13. Vector Image Generation by Learning Parametric Layer Decomposition
#####**Authors**: Othman Sbai,Camille Couprie,Mathieu Aubry
> **Abstract:** Deep image generation is becoming a tool to enhance artists and designers creativity potential. In this paper, we aim at making the generation process easier to understand and interact with. Inspired by vector graphics systems, we propose a new deep generation paradigm where the images are composed of simple layers, defined by their color and a parametric transparency mask. This presents a number of advantages compared to the commonly used convolutional network architectures. In particular, our layered decomposition allows simple user interaction, for example to update a given mask, or change the color of a selected layer. From a compact code, our architecture also generates images with a virtually infinite resolution, the color at each point in an image being a parametric function of its coordinates. We validate the viability of our approach in the auto-encoding framework by comparing reconstructions with state-of-the-art baselines given similar memory resources on CIFAR10, CelebA and ImageNet datasets and demonstrate several applications. We also show Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) results qualitatively different from the ones obtained with common approaches.

####14. Deep Face Image Retrieval: a Comparative Study with Dictionary Learning
#####**Authors**: Ahmad S. Tarawneh,Ahmad B. A. Hassanat,Ceyhun Celik,Dmitry Chetverikov,M. Sohel Rahman,Chaman Verma
> **Abstract:** Facial image retrieval is a challenging task since faces have many similar features (areas), which makes it difficult for the retrieval systems to distinguish faces of different people. With the advent of deep learning, deep networks are often applied to extract powerful features that are used in many areas of computer vision. This paper investigates the application of different deep learning models for face image retrieval, namely, Alexlayer6, Alexlayer7, VGG16layer6, VGG16layer7, VGG19layer6, and VGG19layer7, with two types of dictionary learning techniques, namely $K$-means and $K$-SVD. We also investigate some coefficient learning techniques such as the Homotopy, Lasso, Elastic Net and SSF and their effect on the face retrieval system. The comparative results of the experiments conducted on three standard face image datasets show that the best performers for face image retrieval are Alexlayer7 with $K$-means and SSF, Alexlayer6 with $K$-SVD and SSF, and Alexlayer6 with $K$-means and SSF. The APR and ARR of these methods were further compared to some of the state of the art methods based on local descriptors. The experimental results show that deep learning outperforms most of those methods and therefore can be recommended for use in practice of face image retrieval

####15. Combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series via RNN for object-based   land cover classification
#####**Authors**: Dino Ienco,Raffaele Gaetano,Roberto Interdonato,Kenji Ose,Dinh Ho Tong Minh
> **Abstract:** Radar and Optical Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) are sources of information that are commonly employed to monitor earth surfaces for tasks related to ecology, agriculture, mobility, land management planning and land cover monitoring. Many studies have been conducted using one of the two sources, but how to smartly combine the complementary information provided by radar and optical SITS is still an open challenge. In this context, we propose a new neural architecture for the combination of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery at object level, applied to a real-world land cover classification task. Experiments carried out on the Reunion Island, a overseas department of France in the Indian Ocean, demonstrate the significance of our proposal.

####16. The Pros and Cons: Rank-aware Temporal Attention for Skill Determination   in Long Videos
#####**Authors**: Hazel Doughty,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas,Dima Damen
> **Abstract:** We present a new model to determine relative skill from long videos, through learnable temporal attention modules. Previous work formulates skill determination for common tasks as a ranking problem, yet measures skill from randomly sampled video segments. We believe this approach to be limiting since many parts of the video are irrelevant to assessing skill, and there may be variability in the skill exhibited throughout a video. Assessing skill from a single section may not reflect the overall skill in the video. We propose to train rank-specific temporal attention modules, learned with only video-level supervision, using a novel rank-aware loss function. In addition to attending to task-relevant video parts, our proposed loss jointly trains two attention modules to separately attend to video parts which are indicative of higher (pros) and lower (cons) skills. We evaluate the approach on the public EPIC-Skills dataset and additionally collect and annotate a larger dataset for skill determination with five previously unexplored tasks. Our method outperforms previous approaches and classic softmax attention on both datasets by over 4% pairwise accuracy, and as much as 12% on individual tasks. We also demonstrate our model's ability to attend to rank-aware parts of the video.

####17. Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Damaged Building Detection from   Post-Hurricane Remotely Sensed Imagery
#####**Authors**: Sean Andrew Chen,Andrew Escay,Christopher Haberland,Tessa Schneider,Valentina Staneva,Youngjun Choe
> **Abstract:** Rapid damage assessment is of crucial importance to emergency responders during hurricane events, however, the evaluation process is often slow, labor-intensive, costly, and error-prone. New advances in computer vision and remote sensing open possibilities to observe the Earth at a different scale. However, substantial pre-processing work is still required in order to apply state-of-the-art methodology for emergency response. To enable the comparison of methods for automatic detection of damaged buildings from post-hurricane remote sensing imagery taken from both airborne and satellite sensors, this paper presents the development of benchmark datasets from publicly available data. The major contributions of this work include (1) a scalable framework for creating benchmark datasets of hurricane-damaged buildings and (2) public sharing of the resulting benchmark datasets for Greater Houston area after Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The proposed approach can be used to build other hurricane-damaged building datasets on which researchers can train and test object detection models to automatically identify damaged buildings.

####18. FA-RPN: Floating Region Proposals for Face Detection
#####**Authors**: Mahyar Najibi,Bharat Singh,Larry S. Davis
> **Abstract:** We propose a novel approach for generating region proposals for performing face-detection. Instead of classifying anchor boxes using features from a pixel in the convolutional feature map, we adopt a pooling-based approach for generating region proposals. However, pooling hundreds of thousands of anchors which are evaluated for generating proposals becomes a computational bottleneck during inference. To this end, an efficient anchor placement strategy for reducing the number of anchor-boxes is proposed. We then show that proposals generated by our network (Floating Anchor Region Proposal Network, FA-RPN) are better than RPN for generating region proposals for face detection. We discuss several beneficial features of FA-RPN proposals like iterative refinement, placement of fractional anchors and changing anchors which can be enabled without making any changes to the trained model. Our face detector based on FA-RPN obtains 89.4% mAP with a ResNet-50 backbone on the WIDER dataset.
