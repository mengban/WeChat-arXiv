#### 1. Weakly supervised segment annotation via expectation kernel density   estimation
##### **Authors**: Liantao Wang,Qingwu Li,Jianfeng Lu
> **Abstract:** Since the labelling for the positive images/videos is ambiguous in weakly supervised segment annotation, negative mining based methods that only use the intra-class information emerge. In these methods, negative instances are utilized to penalize unknown instances to rank their likelihood of being an object, which can be considered as a voting in terms of similarity. However, these methods 1) ignore the information contained in positive bags, 2) only rank the likelihood but cannot generate an explicit decision function. In this paper, we propose a voting scheme involving not only the definite negative instances but also the ambiguous positive instances to make use of the extra useful information in the weakly labelled positive bags. In the scheme, each instance votes for its label with a magnitude arising from the similarity, and the ambiguous positive instances are assigned soft labels that are iteratively updated during the voting. It overcomes the limitations of voting using only the negative bags. We also propose an expectation kernel density estimation (eKDE) algorithm to gain further insight into the voting mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme beyond the baselines.

#### 2. Hierarchical Discrete Distribution Decomposition for Match Density   Estimation
##### **Authors**: Zhichao Yin,Trevor Darrell,Fisher Yu
> **Abstract:** Existing deep learning methods for pixel correspondence output a point estimate of the motion field, but do not represent the full match distribution. Explicit representation of a match distribution is desirable for many applications as it allows direct representation of the correspondence probability. The main difficulty of estimating a full probability distribution with a deep network is the high computational cost of inferring the entire distribution. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Discrete Distribution Decomposition, dubbed HD$^3$, to learn probabilistic point and region matching. Not only can it model match uncertainty, but also region propagation. To achieve this, we estimate the hierarchical distribution of pixel correspondences at different image scales without multi-hypotheses ensembling. Despite its simplicity, our method can achieve competitive results for both optical flow and stereo matching on established benchmarks, while the estimated uncertainty is a good indicator of errors. Furthermore, the point match distribution within a region can be grouped together to propagate the whole region even if the area changes across images.

#### 3. PVSNet: Palm Vein Authentication Siamese Network Trained using Triplet   Loss and Adaptive Hard Mining by Learning Enforced Domain Specific Features
##### **Authors**: Daksh Thapar,Gaurav Jaswal,Aditya Nigam,Vivek Kanhangad
> **Abstract:** Designing an end-to-end deep learning network to match the biometric features with limited training samples is an extremely challenging task. To address this problem, we propose a new way to design an end-to-end deep CNN framework i.e., PVSNet that works in two major steps: first, an encoder-decoder network is used to learn generative domain-specific features followed by a Siamese network in which convolutional layers are pre-trained in an unsupervised fashion as an autoencoder. The proposed model is trained via triplet loss function that is adjusted for learning feature embeddings in a way that minimizes the distance between embedding-pairs from the same subject and maximizes the distance with those from different subjects, with a margin. In particular, a triplet Siamese matching network using an adaptive margin based hard negative mining has been suggested. The hyper-parameters associated with the training strategy, like the adaptive margin, have been tuned to make the learning more effective on biometric datasets. In extensive experimentation, the proposed network outperforms most of the existing deep learning solutions on three type of typical vein datasets which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

#### 4. Hinted Networks
##### **Authors**: Joel Lamy-Poirier,Anqi Xu
> **Abstract:** We present Hinted Networks: a collection of architectural transformations for improving the accuracies of neural network models for regression tasks, through the injection of a prior for the output prediction (i.e. a hint). We ground our investigations within the camera relocalization domain, and propose two variants, namely the Hinted Embedding and Hinted Residual networks, both applied to the PoseNet base model for regressing camera pose from an image. Our evaluations show practical improvements in localization accuracy for standard outdoor and indoor localization datasets, without using additional information. We further assess the range of accuracy gains within an aerial-view localization setup, simulated across vast areas at different times of the year.

#### 5. PiCANet: Pixel-wise Contextual Attention Learning for Accurate Saliency   Detection
##### **Authors**: Nian Liu,Junwei Han,Ming-Hsuan Yang
> **Abstract:** In saliency detection, every pixel needs contextual information to make saliency prediction. Previous models usually incorporate contexts holistically. However, for each pixel, usually only part of its context region is useful and contributes to its prediction, while some other part may serve as noises and distractions. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-wise contextual attention network, \ie PiCANet, to learn to selectively attend to informative context locations at each pixel. Specifically, PiCANet generates an attention map over the context region of each pixel, where each attention weight corresponds to the relevance of a context location w.r.t the referred pixel. Then, attentive contextual features can be constructed via selectively incorporating the features of useful context locations with the learned attention. We propose three specific formulations of the PiCANet via embedding the pixel-wise contextual attention mechanism into the pooling and convolution operations with attending to global or local contexts. All the three models are fully differentiable and can be integrated with CNNs with joint training. We introduce the proposed PiCANets into a U-Net architecture for salient object detection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PiCANets can significantly improve the saliency detection performance. The generated global and local attention can learn to incorporate global contrast and smoothness, respectively, which help localize salient objects more accurately and highlight them more uniformly. Consequently, our saliency model performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we also validate that PiCANets can also improve semantic segmentation and object detection performances, which further demonstrates their effectiveness and generalization ability.

#### 6. Action Quality Assessment Across Multiple Actions
##### **Authors**: Paritosh Parmar,Brendan Tran Morris
> **Abstract:** Can learning to measure the quality of an action help in measuring the quality of other actions? If so, can consolidated samples from multiple actions help improve the performance of current approaches? In this paper, we carry out experiments to see if knowledge transfer is possible in the action quality assessment (AQA) setting. Experiments are carried out on our newly released AQA dataset (http://rtis.oit.unlv.edu/datasets.html) consisting of 1106 action samples from seven actions with quality scores as measured by expert human judges. Our experimental results show that there is utility in learning a single model across multiple actions.
