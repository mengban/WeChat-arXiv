### 1. Title This formulation opens\nnew avenues for bottom-up frameworks of multimodal integration.
> Authors： lius, wang
> Abstract:The other one aims to learn interdependencies knowledge between\ndifferent feature channels generated by the last convolution layer. The remains\nof two other branches are identification and triplet sub-networks, in which the\ndiscriminative global feature and a corresponding measurement can be learned.
