#### 1. Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation with Distractor-Aware Online   Adaptation
##### **Authors**: Ye Wang,Jongmoo Choi,Yueru Chen,Siyang Li,Qin Huang,Kaitai Zhang,Ming-Sui Lee,C. -C. Jay Kuo
> **Abstract:** Unsupervised video object segmentation is a crucial application in video analysis without knowing any prior information about the objects. It becomes tremendously challenging when multiple objects occur and interact in a given video clip. In this paper, a novel unsupervised video object segmentation approach via distractor-aware online adaptation (DOA) is proposed. DOA models spatial-temporal consistency in video sequences by capturing background dependencies from adjacent frames. Instance proposals are generated by the instance segmentation network for each frame and then selected by motion information as hard negatives if they exist and positives. To adopt high-quality hard negatives, the block matching algorithm is then applied to preceding frames to track the associated hard negatives. General negatives are also introduced in case that there are no hard negatives in the sequence and experiments demonstrate both kinds of negatives (distractors) are complementary. Finally, we conduct DOA using the positive, negative, and hard negative masks to update the foreground/background segmentation. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, DAVIS 2016 and FBMS-59 datasets.

#### 2. Learning Symmetry Consistent Deep CNNs for Face Completion
##### **Authors**: Xiaoming Li,Ming Liu,Jieru Zhu,Wangmeng Zuo,Meng Wang,Guosheng Hu,Lei Zhang
> **Abstract:** Deep convolutional networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in face completion to generate plausible facial structures. These methods, however, are limited in maintaining global consistency among face components and recovering fine facial details. On the other hand, reflectional symmetry is a prominent property of face image and benefits face recognition and consistency modeling, yet remaining uninvestigated in deep face completion. In this work, we leverage two kinds of symmetry-enforcing subnets to form a symmetry-consistent CNN model (i.e., SymmFCNet) for effective face completion. For missing pixels on only one of the half-faces, an illumination-reweighted warping subnet is developed to guide the warping and illumination reweighting of the other half-face. As for missing pixels on both of half-faces, we present a generative reconstruction subnet together with a perceptual symmetry loss to enforce symmetry consistency of recovered structures. The SymmFCNet is constructed by stacking generative reconstruction subnet upon illumination-reweighted warping subnet, and can be end-to-end learned from training set of unaligned face images. Experiments show that SymmFCNet can generate high quality results on images with synthetic and real occlusion, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts.

#### 3. Cross-Database Micro-Expression Recognition: A Benchmark
##### **Authors**: Yuan Zong,Wenming Zheng,Xiaopeng Hong,Chuangao Tang,Zhen Cui,Guoying Zhao
> **Abstract:** Cross-database micro-expression recognition (CDMER) is one of recently emerging and interesting problem in micro-expression analysis. CDMER is more challenging than the conventional micro-expression recognition (MER), because the training and testing samples in CDMER come from different micro-expression databases, resulting in the inconsistency of the feature distributions between the training and testing sets. In this paper, we contribute to this topic from three aspects. First, we establish a CDMER experimental evaluation protocol aiming to allow the researchers to conveniently work on this topic and provide a standard platform for evaluating their proposed methods. Second, we conduct benchmark experiments by using NINE state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) methods and SIX popular spatiotemporal descriptors for respectively investigating CDMER problem from two different perspectives. Third, we propose a novel DA method called region selective transfer regression (RSTR) to deal with the CDMER task. Our RSTR takes advantage of one important cue for recognizing micro-expressions, i.e., the different contributions of the facial local regions in MER. The overall superior performance of RSTR demonstrates that taking into consideration the important cues benefiting MER, e.g., the facial local region information, contributes to develop effective DA methods for dealing with CDMER problem.

#### 4. Discriminative analysis of the human cortex using spherical CNNs - a   study on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis
##### **Authors**: Xinyang Feng,Jie Yang,Andrew F. Laine,Elsa D. Angelini
> **Abstract:** In neuroimaging studies, the human cortex is commonly modeled as a sphere to preserve the topological structure of the cortical surface. Cortical neuroimaging measures hence can be modeled in spherical representation. In this work, we explore analyzing the human cortex using spherical CNNs in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification task using cortical morphometric measures derived from structural MRI. Our results show superior performance in classifying AD versus cognitively normal and in predicting MCI progression within two years, using structural MRI information only. This work demonstrates for the first time the potential of the spherical CNNs framework in the discriminative analysis of the human cortex and could be extended to other modalities and other neurological diseases.

#### 5. Learning On-Road Visual Control for Self-Driving Vehicles with Auxiliary   Tasks
##### **Authors**: Yilun Chen,Praveen Palanisamy,Priyantha Mudalige,Katharina Muelling,John M. Dolan
> **Abstract:** A safe and robust on-road navigation system is a crucial component of achieving fully automated vehicles. NVIDIA recently proposed an End-to-End algorithm that can directly learn steering commands from raw pixels of a front camera by using one convolutional neural network. In this paper, we leverage auxiliary information aside from raw images and design a novel network structure, called Auxiliary Task Network (ATN), to help boost the driving performance while maintaining the advantage of minimal training data and an End-to-End training method. In this network, we introduce human prior knowledge into vehicle navigation by transferring features from image recognition tasks. Image semantic segmentation is applied as an auxiliary task for navigation. We consider temporal information by introducing an LSTM module and optical flow to the network. Finally, we combine vehicle kinematics with a sensor fusion step. We discuss the benefits of our method over state-of-the-art visual navigation methods both in the Udacity simulation environment and on the real-world Comma.ai dataset.

#### 6. Rotation Ensemble Module for Detecting Rotation-Invariant Features
##### **Authors**: Dongwon Park,Yonghyeok Seo,Se Young Chun
> **Abstract:** Deep learning has improved many computer vision tasks by utilizing data-driven features instead of using hand-crafted features. However, geometric transformations of input images often degrade the performance of deep learning based methods. In particular, rotation-invariant features are important in computer vision tasks such as face detection, biological feature detection of microscopy images, or robot grasp detection since the input image can be fed into the network with any rotation angle. In this paper, we propose rotation ensemble module (REM) to efficiently train and utilize rotation-invariant features in a deep neural network for computer vision tasks. We evaluated our proposed REM with face detection tasks on FDDB dataset, robotic grasp detection tasks on Cornell dataset, and real robotic grasp tasks with several novel objects. REM based face detection deep neural networks yielded up to 50.8% accuracy in face detection task on FDDB dataset at false rate 20 with IOU 75%, which is about 10.7% higher than the baseline. Robotic grasp detection deep neural networks with our REM also yielded up to 97.6% accuracy in robotic grasp detection on Cornell dataset that is higher than current state-of-the-art performance. In robotic grasp task using a real 4-axis robotic arm with several novel objects, our REM based robotic grasp achieved up to 93.8%, which is significantly higher than the baseline robotic grasps (11.0-56.3%).

#### 7. Light Weight Color Image Warping with Inter-Channel Information
##### **Authors**: Chuangye Zhang,Yan Niu,Tieru Wu,Ximing Li
> **Abstract:** Image warping is a necessary step in many multimedia applications such as texture mapping, image-based rendering, panorama stitching, image resizing and optical flow computation etc. Traditionally, color image warping interpolation is performed in each color channel independently. In this paper, we show that the warping quality can be significantly enhanced by exploiting the cross-channel correlation. We design a warping scheme that integrates intra-channel interpolation with cross-channel variation at very low computational cost, which is required for interactive multimedia applications on mobile devices. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated by extensive experiments.

#### 8. Mini-UAV-based Remote Sensing: Techniques, Applications and Prospectives
##### **Authors**: Tian-Zhu Xiang,Gui-Song Xia,Liangpei Zhang
> **Abstract:** The past few decades have witnessed the great progress of unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) in civilian fields, especially in photogrammetry and remote sensing. In contrast with the platforms of manned aircraft and satellite, the UAV platform holds many promising characteristics: flexibility, efficiency, high-spatial/temporal resolution, low cost, easy operation, etc., which make it an effective complement to other remote-sensing platforms and a cost-effective means for remote sensing. Considering the popularity and expansion of UAV-based remote sensing in recent years, this paper provides a systematic survey on the recent advances and future prospectives of UAVs in the remote-sensing community. Specifically, the main challenges and key technologies of remote-sensing data processing based on UAVs are discussed and summarized firstly. Then, we provide an overview of the widespread applications of UAVs in remote sensing. Finally, some prospects for future work are discussed. We hope this paper will provide remote-sensing researchers an overall picture of recent UAV-based remote sensing developments and help guide the further research on this topic.

##### **Authors**: Bruno Lecouat,Ken Chang,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Balagopal Unnikrishnan,James M. Brown,Houssam Zenati,Andrew Beers,Vijay Chandrasekhar,Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer,Pavitra Krishnaswamy
> **Abstract:** Supervised deep learning algorithms have enabled significant performance gains in medical image classification tasks. But these methods rely on large labeled datasets that require resource-intensive expert annotation. Semi-supervised generative adversarial network (GAN) approaches offer a means to learn from limited labeled data alongside larger unlabeled datasets, but have not been applied to discern fine-scale, sparse or localized features that define medical abnormalities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a patch-based semi-supervised learning approach and evaluate performance on classification of diabetic retinopathy from funduscopic images. Our semi-supervised approach achieves high AUC with just 10-20 labeled training images, and outperforms the supervised baselines by upto 15% when less than 30% of the training dataset is labeled. Further, our method implicitly enables interpretation of the SSL predictions. As this approach enables good accuracy, resolution and interpretability with lower annotation burden, it sets the pathway for scalable applications of deep learning in clinical imaging.

#### 10. Physical Attribute Prediction Using Deep Residual Neural Networks
##### **Authors**: Rashidedin Jahandideh,Alireza Tavakoli Targhi,Maryam Tahmasbi
> **Abstract:** Images taken from the Internet have been used alongside Deep Learning for many different tasks such as: smile detection, ethnicity, hair style, hair colour, gender and age prediction. After witnessing these usages, we were wondering what other attributes can be predicted from facial images available on the Internet. In this paper we tackle the prediction of physical attributes from face images using Convolutional Neural Networks trained on our dataset named FIRW. We crawled around 61, 000 images from the web, then use face detection to crop faces from these real world images. We choose ResNet-50 as our base network architecture. This network was pretrained for the task of face recognition by using the VGG-Face dataset, and we finetune it by using our own dataset to predict physical attributes. Separate networks are trained for the prediction of body type, ethnicity, gender, height and weight; our models achieve the following accuracies for theses tasks, respectively: 84.58%, 87.34%, 97.97%, 70.51%, 63.99%. To validate our choice of ResNet-50 as the base architecture, we also tackle the famous CelebA dataset. Our models achieve an averagy accuracy of 91.19% on CelebA, which is comparable to state-of-the-art approaches.

#### 11. Deep Global-Relative Networks for End-to-End 6-DoF Visual Localization   and Odometry
##### **Authors**: Yimin Lin,Zhaoxiang Liu,Jianfeng Huang,Chaopeng Wang,Guoguang Du,Jinqiang Bai,Shiguo Lian,Bill Huang
> **Abstract:** For the autonomous navigation of mobile robots, robust and fast visual localization is a challenging task. Although some end-to-end deep neural networks for 6-DoF Visual Odometry (VO) have been reported with promising results, they are still unable to solve the drift problem in long-range navigation. In this paper, we propose the deep global-relative networks (DGRNets), which is a novel global and relative fusion framework based on Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs). It is designed to jointly estimate global pose and relative localization from consecutive monocular images. DGRNets include feature extraction sub-networks for discriminative feature selection, RCNNs-type relative pose estimation subnetworks for smoothing the VO trajectory and RCNNs-type global pose regression sub-networks for avoiding the accumulation of pose errors. We also propose two loss functions: the first one consists of Cross Transformation Constraints (CTC) that utilize geometric consistency of the adjacent frames to train a more accurate relative sub-networks, and the second one is composed of CTC and Mean Square Error (MSE) between the predicted pose and ground truth used to train the end-to-end DGRNets. The competitive experiments on indoor Microsoft 7-Scenes and outdoor KITTI dataset show that our DGRNets outperform other learning-based monocular VO methods in terms of pose accuracy.

#### 12. Removing rain streaks by a linear model
##### **Authors**: Yinglong Wang,Shuaicheng Liu,Bing Zeng
> **Abstract:** Removing rain streaks from a single image continues to draw attentions today in outdoor vision systems. In this paper, we present an efficient method to remove rain streaks. First, the location map of rain pixels needs to be known as precisely as possible, to which we implement a relatively accurate detection of rain streaks by utilizing two characteristics of rain streaks.The key component of our method is to represent the intensity of each detected rain pixel using a linear model: $p=\alpha s + \beta$, where $p$ is the observed intensity of a rain pixel and $s$ represents the intensity of the background (i.e., before rain-affected). To solve $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for each detected rain pixel, we concentrate on a window centered around it and form an $L_2$-norm cost function by considering all detected rain pixels within the window, where the corresponding rain-removed intensity of each detected rain pixel is estimated by some neighboring non-rain pixels. By minimizing this cost function, we determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$ so as to construct the final rain-removed pixel intensity. Compared with several state-of-the-art works, our proposed method can remove rain streaks from a single color image much more efficiently - it offers not only a better visual quality but also a speed-up of several times to one degree of magnitude.

#### 13. PnP-AdaNet: Plug-and-Play Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network with a   Benchmark at Cross-modality Cardiac Segmentation
##### **Authors**: Qi Dou,Cheng Ouyang,Cheng Chen,Hao Chen,Ben Glocker,Xiahai Zhuang,Pheng-Ann Heng
> **Abstract:** Deep convolutional networks have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance on various medical image computing tasks. Leveraging images from different modalities for the same analysis task holds clinical benefits. However, the generalization capability of deep models on test data with different distributions remain as a major challenge. In this paper, we propose the PnPAdaNet (plug-and-play adversarial domain adaptation network) for adapting segmentation networks between different modalities of medical images, e.g., MRI and CT. We propose to tackle the significant domain shift by aligning the feature spaces of source and target domains in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, a domain adaptation module flexibly replaces the early encoder layers of the source network, and the higher layers are shared between domains. With adversarial learning, we build two discriminators whose inputs are respectively multi-level features and predicted segmentation masks. We have validated our domain adaptation method on cardiac structure segmentation in unpaired MRI and CT. The experimental results with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the excellent efficacy of our proposed PnP-AdaNet. Moreover, we introduce a novel benchmark on the cardiac dataset for the task of unsupervised cross-modality domain adaptation. We will make our code and database publicly available, aiming to promote future studies on this challenging yet important research topic in medical imaging.

#### 14. Dynamic Programming Approach to Template-based OCR
##### **Authors**: M. A. Povolotskiy,D. V. Tropin
> **Abstract:** In this paper we propose a dynamic programming solution to the template-based recognition task in OCR case. We formulate a problem of optimal position search for complex objects consisting of parts forming a sequence. We limit the distance between every two adjacent elements with predefined upper and lower thresholds. We choose the sum of penalties for each part in given position as a function to be minimized. We show that such a choice of restrictions allows a faster algorithm to be used than the one for the general form of deformation penalties. We named this algorithm Dynamic Squeezeboxes Packing (DSP) and applied it to solve the two OCR problems: text fields extraction from an image of document Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ) and license plate segmentation. The quality and the performance of resulting solutions were experimentally proved to meet the requirements of the state-of-the-art industrial recognition systems.

#### 15. Accurate Hand Keypoint Localization on Mobile Devices
##### **Authors**: Filippos Gouidis,Paschalis Panteleris,Iason Oikonomidis,Antonis Argyros
> **Abstract:** We present a novel approach for 2D hand keypoint localization from regular color input. The proposed approach relies on an appropriately designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that computes a set of heatmaps, one per hand keypoint of interest. Extensive experiments with the proposed method compare it against state of the art approaches and demonstrate its accuracy and computational performance on standard, publicly available datasets. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method matches or outperforms the competing methods in accuracy, but clearly outperforms them in computational efficiency, making it a suitable building block for applications that require hand keypoint estimation on mobile devices.

#### 16. Multitask Painting Categorization by Deep Multibranch Neural Network
##### **Authors**: Simone Bianco,Davide Mazzini,Paolo Napoletano,Raimondo Schettini
> **Abstract:** In this work we propose a new deep multibranch neural network to solve the tasks of artist, style, and genre categorization in a multitask formulation. In order to gather clues from low-level texture details and, at the same time, exploit the coarse layout of the painting, the branches of the proposed networks are fed with crops at different resolutions. We propose and compare two different crop strategies: the first one is a random-crop strategy that permits to manage the tradeoff between accuracy and speed; the second one is a smart extractor based on Spatial Transformer Networks trained to extract the most representative subregions. Furthermore, inspired by the results obtained in other domains, we experiment the joint use of hand-crafted features directly computed on the input images along with neural ones. Experiments are performed on a new dataset originally sourced from wikiart.org and hosted by Kaggle, and made suitable for artist, style and genre multitask learning. The dataset here proposed, named MultitaskPainting100k, is composed by 100K paintings, 1508 artists, 125 styles and 41 genres. Our best method, tested on the MultitaskPainting100k dataset, achieves accuracy levels of 56.5%, 57.2%, and 63.6% on the tasks of artist, style and genre prediction respectively.

#### 17. Balanced Random Forest Classifier in WEKA
##### **Authors**: Mario Amrehn,Firas Mualla,Elli Angelopoulou,Stefan Steidl,Andreas Maier
> **Abstract:** Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, providing automated techniques to predict further information based on observations. One of these classification and regression techniques is the random forest approach. Those decision tree based predictors are best known for their good computational performance and scalability. However, in case of severely imbalanced training data, as often seen in medical studies' data with large control groups, the training algorithm or the sampling process has to be altered in order to improve the prediction quality for minority classes. In this work, a balanced random forest approach for WEKA is proposed. Furthermore, the prediction quality of the unmodified random forest implementation and the new balanced random forest version for WEKA are evaluated against reference implementations in R. Two-class problems on balanced data sets and imbalanced medical studies' data are investigated. A superior prediction quality using the proposed method for imbalanced data is shown compared to the other three techniques.

#### 18. Multi-Shot Sensitivity-Encoded Diffusion MRI using Model-Based Deep   Learning (MODL-MUSSELS)
##### **Authors**: Hemant Kumar Aggarwal,Merry P. Mani,Mathews Jacob
> **Abstract:** We propose a model-based deep learning architecture for the correction of phase errors in multishot diffusion-weighted echo-planar MRI images. This work is a generalization of MUSSELS, which is a structured low-rank algorithm. We show that an iterative reweighted least-squares implementation of MUSSELS resembles the model-based deep learning (MoDL) framework. We propose to replace the self-learned linear filter bank in MUSSELS with a convolutional neural network, whose parameters are learned from exemplary data. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity of MUSSELS by several orders of magnitude while providing comparable image quality.

#### 19. Very Power Efficient Neural Time-of-Flight
##### **Authors**: Yan Chen,Jimmy Ren,Xuanye Cheng,Keyuan Qian,Jinwei Gu
> **Abstract:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras require active illumination to obtain depth information thus the power of illumination directly affects the performance of ToF cameras. Traditional ToF imaging algorithms is very sensitive to illumination and the depth accuracy degenerates rapidly with the power of it. Therefore, the design of a power efficient ToF camera always creates a painful dilemma for the illumination and the performance trade-off. In this paper, we show that despite the weak signals in many areas under extreme short exposure setting, these signals as a whole can be well utilized through a learning process which directly translates the weak and noisy ToF camera raw to depth map. This creates an opportunity to tackle the aforementioned dilemma and make a very power efficient ToF camera possible. To enable the learning, we collect a comprehensive dataset under a variety of scenes and photographic conditions by a specialized ToF camera. Experiments show that our method is able to robustly process ToF camera raw with the exposure time of one order of magnitude shorter than that used in conventional ToF cameras. In addition to evaluating our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively, we also discuss its implication to designing the next generation power efficient ToF cameras. We will make our dataset and code publicly available.

#### 20. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting using Recurrent Neural Networks
##### **Authors**: Ilkay Oksuz,Gastao Cruz,James Clough,Aurelien Bustin,Nicolo Fuin,Rene M. Botnar,Claudia Prieto,Andrew P. King,Julia A. Schnabel
> **Abstract:** Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a new approach to quantitative magnetic resonance imaging that allows simultaneous measurement of multiple tissue properties in a single, time-efficient acquisition. Standard MRF reconstructs parametric maps using dictionary matching and lacks scalability due to computational inefficiency. We propose to perform MRF map reconstruction using a recurrent neural network, which exploits the time-dependent information of the MRF signal evolution. We evaluate our method on multiparametric synthetic signals and compare it to existing MRF map reconstruction approaches, including those based on neural networks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art estimates of T1 and T2 values. In addition, the reconstruction time is significantly reduced compared to dictionary-matching based approaches.

#### 21. Unsupervised Event-based Learning of Optical Flow, Depth, and Egomotion
##### **Authors**: Alex Zihao Zhu,Liangzhe Yuan,Kenneth Chaney,Kostas Daniilidis
> **Abstract:** In this work, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised learning for event cameras that learns motion information from only the event stream. In particular, we propose an input representation of the events in the form of a discretized volume that maintains the temporal distribution of the events, which we pass through a neural network to predict the motion of the events. This motion is used to attempt to remove any motion blur in the event image. We then propose a loss function applied to the motion compensated event image that measures the motion blur in this image. We train two networks with this framework, one to predict optical flow, and one to predict egomotion and depths, and evaluate these networks on the Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera dataset, along with qualitative results from a variety of different scenes.
