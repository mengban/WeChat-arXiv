####1. Deep Active Learning for Video-based Person Re-identification
#####**Authors**: Menglin Wang,Baisheng Lai,Zhongming Jin,Xiaojin Gong,Jianqiang Huang,Xiansheng Hua
> **Abstract:** It is prohibitively expensive to annotate a large-scale video-based person re-identification (re-ID) dataset, which makes fully supervised methods inapplicable to real-world deployment. How to maximally reduce the annotation cost while retaining the re-ID performance becomes an interesting problem. In this paper, we address this problem by integrating an active learning scheme into a deep learning framework. Noticing that the truly matched tracklet-pairs, also denoted as true positives (TP), are the most informative samples for our re-ID model, we propose a sampling criterion to choose the most TP-likely tracklet-pairs for annotation. A view-aware sampling strategy considering view-specific biases is designed to facilitate candidate selection, followed by an adaptive resampling step to leave out the selected candidates that are unnecessary to annotate. Our method learns the re-ID model and updates the annotation set iteratively. The re-ID model is supervised by the tracklets' pesudo labels that are initialized by treating each tracklet as a distinct class. With the gained annotations of the actively selected candidates, the tracklets' pesudo labels are updated by label merging and further used to re-train our re-ID model. While being simple, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness on three video-based person re-ID datasets. Experimental results show that less than 3\% pairwise annotations are needed for our method to reach comparable performance with the fully-supervised setting.

####2. AU R-CNN: Encoding Expert Prior Knowledge into R-CNN for Action Unit   Detection
#####**Authors**: Chen Ma,Li Chen,Junhai Yong
> **Abstract:** Modeling action units (AUs) on human faces is challenging because various AUs cause subtle facial appearance changes over various regions at different scales. Current works have attempted to recognize AUs by emphasizing important regions. However, the incorporation of prior knowledge into region definition remains under-exploited, and current AU detection systems do not use regional convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) with expert prior knowledge to directly focus on AU-related regions adaptively. By incorporating expert prior knowledge, we propose a novel R-CNN based model named AU R-CNN. The proposed solution offers two main contributions: (1) AU R-CNN directly observes different facial regions, where various AUs are located. Expert prior knowledge is encoded in the region and the RoI-level label definition. This design produces considerably better detection performance than do existing approaches. (2) We also integrate various dynamic models (including convolutional long short-term memory, two stream network, conditional random field, and temporal action localization network) into AU R-CNN and then investigate and analyze the reason behind the performance of dynamic models. Experiment results demonstrate that only static RGB image information and no optical flow-based AU R-CNN surpasses the one fused with dynamic models. AU R-CNN is also superior to traditional CNNs that use the same backbone on varying image resolutions. State-of-the-art recognition performance of AU detection is achieved. The complete network is end-to-end trainable. Experiments on BP4D and DISFA datasets show the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made available.

####3. Pyramid Network with Online Hard Example Mining for Accurate Left Atrium   Segmentation
#####**Authors**: Cheng Bian,Xin Yang,Jianqiang Ma,Shen Zheng,Yu-An Liu,Reza Nezafat,Pheng-Ann Heng,Yefeng Zheng
> **Abstract:** Accurately segmenting left atrium in MR volume can benefit the ablation procedure of atrial fibrillation. Traditional automated solutions often fail in relieving experts from the labor-intensive manual labeling. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based solution for automated left atrium segmentation in gadolinium-enhanced MR volumes with promising performance. We firstly argue that, for this volumetric segmentation task, networks in 2D fashion can present great superiorities in time efficiency and segmentation accuracy than networks with 3D fashion. Considering the highly varying shape of atrium and the branchy structure of associated pulmonary veins, we propose to adopt a pyramid module to collect semantic cues in feature maps from multiple scales for fine-grained segmentation. Also, to promote our network in classifying the hard examples, we propose an Online Hard Negative Example Mining strategy to identify voxels in slices with low classification certainties and penalize the wrong predictions on them. Finally, we devise a competitive training scheme to further boost the generalization ability of networks. Extensively verified on 20 testing volumes, our proposed framework achieves an average Dice of 92.83% in segmenting the left atria and pulmonary veins.

####4. A Self-Supervised Bootstrap Method for Single-Image 3D Face   Reconstruction
#####**Authors**: Yifan Xing,Rahul Tewari,Paulo R. S. Mendonca
> **Abstract:** State-of-the-art methods for 3D reconstruction of faces from a single image require 2D-3D pairs of ground-truth data for supervision. Such data is costly to acquire, and most datasets available in the literature are restricted to pairs for which the input 2D images depict faces in a near fronto-parallel pose. Therefore, many data-driven methods for single-image 3D facial reconstruction perform poorly on profile and near-profile faces. We propose a method to improve the performance of single-image 3D facial reconstruction networks by utilizing the network to synthesize its own training data for fine-tuning, comprising: (i) single-image 3D reconstruction of faces in near-frontal images without ground-truth 3D shape; (ii) application of a rigid-body transformation to the reconstructed face model; (iii) rendering of the face model from new viewpoints; and (iv) use of the rendered image and corresponding 3D reconstruction as additional data for supervised fine-tuning. The new 2D-3D pairs thus produced have the same high-quality observed for near fronto-parallel reconstructions, thereby nudging the network towards more uniform performance as a function of the viewing angle of input faces. Application of the proposed technique to the fine-tuning of a state-of-the-art single-image 3D-reconstruction network for faces demonstrates the usefulness of the method, with particularly significant gains for profile or near-profile views.

####5. Combating Uncertainty with Novel Losses for Automatic Left Atrium   Segmentation
#####**Authors**: Xin Yang,Na Wang,Yi Wang,Xu Wang,Reza Nezafat,Dong Ni,Pheng-Ann Heng
> **Abstract:** Segmenting left atrium in MR volume holds great potentials in promoting the treatment of atrial fibrillation. However, the varying anatomies, artifacts and low contrasts among tissues hinder the advance of both manual and automated solutions. In this paper, we propose a fully-automated framework to segment left atrium in gadolinium-enhanced MR volumes. The region of left atrium is firstly automatically localized by a detection module. Our framework then originates with a customized 3D deep neural network to fully explore the spatial dependency in the region for segmentation. To alleviate the risk of low training efficiency and potential overfitting, we enhance our deep network with the transfer learning and deep supervision strategy. Main contribution of our network design lies in the composite loss function to combat the boundary ambiguity and hard examples. We firstly adopt the Overlap loss to encourage network reduce the overlap between the foreground and background and thus sharpen the predictions on boundary. We then propose a novel Focal Positive loss to guide the learning of voxel-specific threshold and emphasize the foreground to improve classification sensitivity. Further improvement is obtained with an recursive training scheme. With ablation studies, all the introduced modules prove to be effective. The proposed framework achieves an average Dice of 92.24 in segmenting left atrium with pulmonary veins on 20 testing volumes.

####6. ESIR: End-to-end Scene Text Recognition via Iterative Image   Rectification
#####**Authors**: Fangneng Zhan,Shijian Lu
> **Abstract:** Automated recognition of texts in scenes has been a research challenge for years, largely due to the arbitrary variation of text appearances in perspective distortion, text line curvature, text styles and different types of imaging artifacts. The recent deep networks are capable of learning robust representations with respect to imaging artifacts and text style changes, but still face various problems while dealing with scene texts with perspective and curvature distortions. This paper presents an end-to-end trainable scene text recognition system (ESIR) that iteratively removes perspective distortion and text line curvature as driven by better scene text recognition performance. An innovative rectification network is developed which employs a novel line-fitting transformation to estimate the pose of text lines in scenes. In addition, an iterative rectification pipeline is developed where scene text distortions are corrected iteratively towards a fronto-parallel view. The ESIR is also robust to parameter initialization and the training needs only scene text images and word-level annotations as required by most scene text recognition systems. Extensive experiments over a number of public datasets show that the proposed ESIR is capable of rectifying scene text distortions accurately, achieving superior recognition performance for both normal scene text images and those suffering from perspective and curvature distortions.

####7. Combining Deep and Depth: Deep Learning and Face Depth Maps for Driver   Attention Monitoring
#####**Authors**: Guido Borghi
> **Abstract:** Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved promising results in various fields of computer vision. In this paper, we investigate the combination of deep learning based methods and depth maps as input images to tackle the problem of driver attention monitoring. Moreover, we assume the concept of attention as Head Pose Estimation and Facial Landmark Detection tasks. Differently from other proposals in the literature, the proposed systems are able to work directly and based only on raw depth data. All presented methods are trained and tested on two new public datasets, namely Pandora and MotorMark, achieving state-of-art results and running with real time performance.

####8. Spatial Fusion GAN for Image Synthesis
#####**Authors**: Fangneng Zhan,Hongyuan Zhu,Shijian Lu
> **Abstract:** Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great potentials in realistic image synthesis whereas most existing works address synthesis realism in either appearance space or geometry space but few in both. This paper presents an innovative Spatial Fusion GAN (SF-GAN) that combines a geometry synthesizer and an appearance synthesizer to achieve synthesis realism in both geometry and appearance spaces. The geometry synthesizer learns contextual geometries of background images and transforms and places foreground objects into the background images unanimously. The appearance synthesizer adjusts the color, brightness and styles of the foreground objects and embeds them into background images harmoniously, where a guided filter is introduced for detail preserving. The two synthesizers are inter-connected as mutual references which can be trained end-to-end without supervision. The SF-GAN has been evaluated in two tasks: (1) realistic scene text image synthesis for training better recognition models; (2) glass and hat wearing for realistic matching glasses and hats with real portraits. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SF-GAN.

####9. Multi-hypothesis contextual modeling for semantic segmentation
#####**Authors**: Hasan F. Ates,Sercan Sunetci
> **Abstract:** Semantic segmentation (i.e. image parsing) aims to annotate each image pixel with its corresponding semantic class label. Spatially consistent labeling of the image requires an accurate description and modeling of the local contextual information. Segmentation result is typically improved by Markov Random Field (MRF) optimization on the initial labels. However this improvement is limited by the accuracy of initial result and how the contextual neighborhood is defined. In this paper, we develop generalized and flexible contextual models for segmentation neighborhoods in order to improve parsing accuracy. Instead of using a fixed segmentation and neighborhood definition, we explore various contextual models for fusion of complementary information available in alternative segmentations of the same image. In other words, we propose a novel MRF framework that describes and optimizes the contextual dependencies between multiple segmentations. Simulation results on two common datasets demonstrate significant improvement in parsing accuracy over the baseline approaches.

####10. The Coherent Point Drift for Clustered Point Sets
#####**Authors**: Dmitry Lachinov,Vadim Turlapov
> **Abstract:** The problem of non-rigid point set registration is a key problem for many computer vision tasks. In many cases the nature of the data or capabilities of the point detection algorithms can give us some prior information on point sets distribution. In non-rigid case this information is able to drastically improve registration results by limiting number of possible solutions. In this paper we explore use of prior information about point sets clustering, such information can be obtained with preliminary segmentation. We extend existing probabilistic framework for fitting two level Gaussian mixture model and derive closed form solution for maximization step of the EM algorithm. This enables us to improve method accuracy with almost no performance loss. We evaluate our approach and compare the Cluster Coherent Point Drift with other existing non-rigid point set registration methods and show it's advantages for digital medicine tasks, especially for heart template model personalization using patient's medical data.

####11. Advanced Super-Resolution using Lossless Pooling Convolutional Networks
#####**Authors**: Farzad Toutounchi,Ebroul Izquierdo
> **Abstract:** In this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based approach for still image super-resolution, that unlike the mainstream models does not rely solely on the input low resolution image for high quality upsampling, and takes advantage of a set of artificially created auxiliary self-replicas of the input image that are incorporated in the neural network to create an enhanced and accurate upscaling scheme. Inclusion of the proposed lossless pooling layers, and the fusion of the input self-replicas enable the model to exploit the high correlation between multiple instances of the same content, and eventually result in significant improvements in the quality of the super-resolution, which is confirmed by extensive evaluations.

####12. Fast Mitochondria Segmentation for Connectomics
#####**Authors**: Vincent Casser,Kai Kang,Hanspeter Pfister,Daniel Haehn
> **Abstract:** In connectomics, scientists create the wiring diagram of a mammalian brain by identifying synaptic connections between neurons in nano-scale electron microscopy images. This allows for the identification of dysfunctional mitochondria which are linked to a variety of diseases such as autism or bipolar. However, manual analysis is not feasible since connectomics datasets can be petabytes in size. To process such large data, we present a fully automatic mitochondria detector based on a modified U-Net architecture that yields high accuracy and fast processing times. We evaluate our method on multiple real-world connectomics datasets, including an improved version of the EPFL Hippocampus mitochondria detection benchmark. Our results show a Jaccard index of up to 0.90 with inference speeds lower than 16ms for a 512x512 image tile. This speed is faster than the acquisition time of modern electron microscopes, allowing mitochondria detection in real-time. Compared to previous work, our detector ranks first among real-time methods and third overall. Our data, results, and code are freely available.

####13. Automatic quantification of the LV function and mass: a deep learning   approach for cardiovascular MRI
#####**Authors**: Ariel H. Curiale,Flavio D. Colavecchia,German Mato
> **Abstract:** Objective: This paper proposes a novel approach for automatic left ventricle (LV) quantification using convolutional neural networks (CNN).   Methods: The general framework consists of one CNN for detecting the LV, and another for tissue classification. Also, three new deep learning architectures were proposed for LV quantification. These new CNNs introduce the ideas of sparsity and depthwise separable convolution into the U-net architecture, as well as, a residual learning strategy level-to-level. To this end, we extend the classical U-net architecture and use the generalized Jaccard distance as optimization objective function.   Results: The CNNs were trained and evaluated with 140 patients from two public cardiovascular magnetic resonance datasets (Sunnybrook and Cardiac Atlas Project) by using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. Our results demonstrate a suitable accuracy for myocardial segmentation ($\sim$0.9 Dice's coefficient), and a strong correlation with the most relevant physiological measures: 0.99 for end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, 0.97 for the left myocardial mass, 0.95 for the ejection fraction and 0.93 for the stroke volume and cardiac output.   Conclusion: Our simulation and clinical evaluation results demonstrate the capability and merits of the proposed CNN to estimate different structural and functional features such as LV mass and EF which are commonly used for both diagnosis and treatment of different pathologies.   Significance: This paper suggests a new approach for automatic LV quantification based on deep learning where errors are comparable to the inter- and intra-operator ranges for manual contouring. Also, this approach may have important applications on motion quantification.
